## Speed Reader

> Grade: A+

```
Code By: Daniel Nguyen - 173005214 & others (see Group Members)
Course: Intro to Computers for Engineers
Professor: Philip Brown

Description:
For this project, we were required to work in groups of 4 to 5 and create one of the 4 available projects.
Unfortunately, my first choice of working on the chess board project was not granted as they had picked enough
students to work on that one already. Thus, I was defaulted into the "Speed Reader" project instead.

This was a simple project, only requiring effort on figuring out how to code the GUI. I created the final design
of the GUI, coded the basic code that was used in the final project, coded some of the GUI, and did most of the 
workload along with teammate Andrew Russomango.
